# Project Exam 1

![image](/app/assets/index-page.png)

A simple overview of the use/purpose of this project.

## Description

This project is part of my time as a student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media to become a front end dev.
I was tasked to use WP as a headless CMS, and use Netlify as the front-end for the project. I decided to create a blog where I collected some posts regarding conspiracy theories.

The reason for going with this type of blog is because it is currently a hot topic around the world and it is something that I am interested in( at least at the time of making this readme file).

I wanted a theme that is dark and a feel of secrets, seriousness and professional, and I feel that I manage to produce something that is exactly what I need.  

The posts and post details, links and images, are loaded into the page from WordPress acting as a headless CMS. 

Under in [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments) you will find information about where some of the code is been rewritten from, and customized to fit my needs and use. 

In the page itself you will find posts that is found elsewhere on the page, all of them have links to the original source for the information. 

## Built With

You can list a the tech stack that you've used over here

- [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installing

```bash
Download .zip or open with github desktop
```

```bash
if(download .zip === true){ 
    then you will need to unzip the download to be able to open the page in the browser.
};
```

### Running

This is a static page. So to run this in the browser i would suggest to use visual studio code extension [Live Server Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=negokaz.live-server-preview)

```bash
Right click on the HTML page, choose live preview
```
